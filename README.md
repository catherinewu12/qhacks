#Chrome Extension Project 
This extension accepts user input to prevent spoilers from appearing on webpages while on Chrome.

#Installation
Download the qhacks folder. Go to "More Tools" --> "Extensions". Load unpacked and choose the qhacks folder.
Now in a new webpage, there should be an icon prompt which allows input of a movie name. After hitting [Enter], 
all instances of spoilers for that movie should be hidden from your internet adventures!
